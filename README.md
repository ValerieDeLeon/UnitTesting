### Advanced Java Topics With Android Studio

#### 11/5/2019

> You will be creating some original programs that have Unit Testing included. These will be added to the class organization repo.
You will be required to create one for each type of structure:
-Simple output
-If
-If/else
-if/elseif (else is optional on this one)
-While
-for
-1D array
-2D array
-ArrayList
Included with each file you will need a document that includes 1) what structure you are testing, a scenario (story) to accompany, a sample to demonstrate.
Your unit testing must be rigorous! In most cases this should be at least four cases.

--Pertinent Info (-environment, reflections, lessons learned, favorite part, challenges, etc.) This does not need to be lengthy.
